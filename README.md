my info organization app for Bookmark, Favorites, Websites, URLs, Locations, with Sync &amp; Label AI


 I'd like to make a program to sync my bookmarks and favorite websites accross all the webrowsers I have installed into this program and have a smart AI category label system be able to add a field to add a descriptive word and be able to search for those or a word.  I would also like it do be able to group several websites URLs in together when they are for the same company but different web domains.  Please ask me some questions so we can make this an excellent program for people to enjoy using and be able to fullfill these needs for organization.  I would love for you to mention any other indeas or features you feel I should consider including.
 
 Currently I use Windows 11, and commonly use Edge, Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Vivaldi, and Brave.  Most desktop usage, but I also use an Android phone with Chrome browser.  I could have thousands of bookmarks, and would like to be able to search for duplicate and be able to select to remove the ones that are the same URL domain.  I currently organize my bookmarks into nested folders named categories of themes, topics, and areas of study.  Mostly I am looking to organize my bookmarks and be more searchable.  I think another feature would be to check for deadlinks, by attempting connections to bookmarks that have not been connected to longest time ago.  Yes I'd like to sync between several browsers and several devices, and sync to cloud drives such as Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox, AWS drive, and able to add an unmentioned storage by api.  I think the ability to tag bookmarks with keywords for searching is nessessary.  Folder can help ogranize bookmarks, but also would like to see a advance search & sort to be able to check, edit, tag, move, or modify.  Being able to add notes and share also sound like good features as well to be able to export and import from browsers or html, and csv files.
